## The Blog

Personal blog, for documenting things I've learned and built. Discussions are welcomed!

### What I cannot create, I do not understand

Quote by Richard Feynman in 1988. The best way to learn about something is getting your hands dirty.

### Why "IsaacTheBlog"?

Just a weird naming convention of mine. I'm *IsaacTheMan* on GitHub, so naturally this site is *IsaacTheBlog*.

Hey there, I'm Yu-Kai "Steven" Wang, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science as an undergraduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. As an international student from Taiwan, I have always been fascinated by the incredible advancements in technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.

Living in a time where AI can pass doctorate-level tests and create realistic images that are almost indistinguishable from those made by humans is truly remarkable. I'm intrigued by the potential applications of AI in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, to name a few. I'm also interested in exploring the ethical implications of AI and the responsibility that comes with developing and deploying these technologies.

As a computer science student, I'm thrilled to be learning about AI and the various techniques used to develop these systems, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I'm also involved in several AI-related projects and research initiatives, which has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in this rapidly evolving field.

Overall, I'm excited to be a part of this technological revolution and to contribute to the development of AI systems that can make a positive impact on society. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to see where this incredible field will take us in the future.
