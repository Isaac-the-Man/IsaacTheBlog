Do you want to incorporate artificial intelligence in your business model to boost productivity? Perhaps you want to build a fully autonomous AI influencer that generates cat videos? Or, are you looking for a custom website that can impress your friends and family?

I specialize in applying machine learning techniques (classic MLs, state-of-the-art LLMs, Vision Transformers) to tackle problems in various fields, from predicting voltage drops in an IC using a time series model, to extracting keywords in a paper with NLP.

I'm a Taiwanese international student pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I like learning about new tech, making smart electronics, traveling, and science fiction.

Oh, I also build cool websites.

### What I cannot create, I do not understand

Richard Feynman, 1988. The best way to learn about something is to get your hands dirty. This blog documents things I've learned and built. Discussions are welcomed!
